## covid_19_vax

In this project, I use the [plotly-dash libraries](https://plotly.com/dash/) to build a simple dashboard
which monitors the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations across the world. The data
is collected daily by [Gabriel Preda](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda) from [Our World in Data's](https://ourworldindata.org/) [GitHub
repository for COVID-19](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), merged, and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress).

The motivation behind the project is to showcase my ability to create interactive
data visualizations.

I deployed the dashboard via Heroku -- [covid-19-vax.herokuapp.com](https://covid-19-vax.herokuapp.com/).
Please feel free to experiment with the country and statistic selections. You
can also zoom into the graph by clicking and dragging to make a selection :)
