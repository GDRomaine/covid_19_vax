## covid_19_vax

In this project, I use the plotly-dash libraries to build a simple dashboard
which monitors the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations across the world. The
motivation behind the project is to showcase my ability to create interactive
data visualizations.

I deployed the dashboard via Heroku -- [covid-19-vax.herokuapp.com](https://covid-19-vax.herokuapp.com/).
Please feel free to experiment with the country and statistic selections. You
can also zoom into the graph by clicking and dragging to make a selection :)
